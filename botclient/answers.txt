Only in your dreams.
It is decidedly so.
Without a doubt.
Yup dummy.
Yes definitely.
Maybe.
You may rely on it.
You are so funny, I forgot to laugh.

Most likely.
I forgot what I was going to answer lol.

Yes.
Signs point to yes.

If you stop asking stupid questions, might say yes later.
Ask again later.
Better not tell you now.
Cannot predict now.
Eeew no.
Concentrate and ask again.
Why don't you ask your mom? ;)
Don't count on it.
My reply is no.
My sources say no.
Outlook not so good.
Very doubtful.

Ask me if I care.
Hell yeah.
